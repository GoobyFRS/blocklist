# Goobs Blocklist

Goobs Curated Blocklist for PiHole - There is nothing particularly special about it. When ads slip past my other lists, I'll try and capture them here.

**Last Update:** 2026-01-09

Add the following URL to your Pi-Hole Adlist to use my blocklist.

```url

```

**Common Blocklist**

```url

```

**Common Whitelist Testing**
